<div> <h1>About WhatsUp</h1> <br> <p> <b>WhatsUp</b> is a university-based event discovery platform that allows everyone to find out about events happening / hosted at the university! <br> <br> This web app / platform is aiming to become something like the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank"><b>Reddit</b></a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank"><b>HackerNews</b></a> for events. <br> <br> This app is constantly growing, and new features are constantly being added to enhance the usability and power of this platform. <br> <br> </p> <hr> <h2>About Me</h2> <p> My name is Wei-En Wong, and I am currently a 4th year Computer Science student at University of Waterloo. As you can probably tell, I'm a bit of a computer geek who enjoys writing web applications (specifically API driven web-apps) in languages like Ruby, NodeJS and Python. </p> <p> I also enjoy playing and tinkering with hardware, which ranges from RaspberryPi hacks to building my own gaming PC (Yes, I'm also a bit of a gamer). </p> <p> What I think is awesome, is the ability to use technology to help others. I run a side project, refurbishing computers and donating them to low-income families in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region as well as inner-city neighborhoods in Toronto. Over the past 5 years, we have refurbished and donated over 70 computers. </p> <p> <b>Ways to find / contact me:</b> </p><p> If you have any events you would like to posted on this platform, or have any questions, comments, and/or concerns, please email me at: </p> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:weienwong.93@gmail.com"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></i><b> weienwong.93@gmail.com</b></a></li> </ul>  <hr> </div>
