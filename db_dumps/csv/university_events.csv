998,Michele Piscitelli:  Ultralow Field MRI and Beyond: Exploring current applications of SQUID-detected NMR,Michele Piscitelli, Royal Holloway UniversityThe focus of this talk will be a general introduction to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) detection schemes that are based on the use of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) as highly sensitive magnetometers. I will begin by providing an overview of the relevant concepts and principles behind SQUID-detected NMR. In the main part of my talk I will be presenting our experimental results and achievements in the field of ultralow field SQUID NMR spectroscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This will be followed by a brief showcase of various interesting SQUID NMR applications in the field of Biodiagnostics that have been developed over the past few years. I will conclude by outlining some current research into further applications based on SQUID NMR systems.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/events/michele-piscitelli-ultralow-field-mri-and-beyond-exploring,40
1022,Seminar - Prashant Doshi,SpeakerPrashant Doshi, Associate Professor, Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of WaterlooTopicGeneralizing Inverse Reinforcement Learning for the Real WorldAbstractInverse reinforcement learning (IRL) investigates ways by which a learner may approximate the preferences of an expert by observing the experts actions over time. Usually, the expert is modeled as optimizing its actions using a Markov decision process (MDP), whose parameters except for the reward function are known to the learner. IRL is enjoying much success and attention in applications such as robots learning tasks from demonstrations by human experts and in imitation learning. However, operational settings for traditional IRL are restrictive. In this talk, I will present methods for generalizing IRL to contexts that involve multiple observed robots, which may interact and whose observed trajectories are partially occluded from the learner. I will also explore generalizing IRL to settings where additional parameters of others' MDPs are unknown. These are all challenges encountered in real-world contexts. We evaluate these methods in the context of an application setting involving two mobile robots executing simple cyclic trajectories for perimeter patrolling. Both robots patrolling motions are disturbed when they approach each other in narrow corridors leading to an interaction. A subject robot observes them from a hidden vantage point that affords partial observability of their trajectories only. It s task is to penetrate the patrols and reach a goal location without being spotted. Thus, its eventual actions do not impact the other robots. Videos of demonstration runs will be shown.Speaker's biographyDr. Prashant Doshi is an Associate Professor of Computer Science, director of the THINC Lab (http://thinc.cs.uga.edu) and is a faculty member of the AI Institute at the University of Georgia, USA.

Public lecture by Dr. Krysta Svore, Microsoft ResearchIn 1981, Richard Feynman proposed a device called a quantum computer to take advantage of the laws of quantum physics to achieve computational speed-ups over classical methods. Quantum computing promises to revolutionize how we compute. Over the course of three decades, quantum algorithms have been developed that offer fast solutions to problems in a variety of fields including number theory, optimization, chemistry, physics, and materials science. Quantum devices have also significantly advanced such that components of a scalable quantum computer have been demonstrated in a variety of quantum systems. In this talk, I will attempt to reveal some of the mysteries of this disruptive computational paradigm. I will showcase recent advances in quantum algorithms for real-world applications and in scalable, fault-tolerant devices.Registration is required,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/events/quantum-computing-transforming-digital-age,26

1025,Department seminar by David Tyler, Rutgers,Robust Covariances: Structured Models and RegularizationIn this talk, robust estimation of the covariance matrix is considered whenever constrains are placed on the covariance matrix. Such models are particularly important whenever there is low or insufficient sample support (small n, large p).Graphical models over the class of elliptical distributions are first considered. The robust estimators considered here are the graphical M-estimators and the plug-in M-estimators. The graphical M-estimators, refer to estimators obtained by optimized a robust loss criterion over the restricted scatter structures imposed by a graphical model, whereas the plug-in M-estimators refer to the estimators obtained by substituting an M-estimate of scatter (or any other robust estimate of scatter) for the sample covariance matrix in classical algorithm for the Gaussian graphical model. It turns out that, under suitable conditions, both approaches yield the same asymptotic efficiency. For relatively small sample sizes, however, the graphical M-estimator is more robust and more efficient that the plug-in M-estimator. This research is joint with Daniel Vogel, University of Aberdeen, Scotland.Next, soft modeling or regularization is considered. Here, a general class of regularized M-estimators for scatter is proposed. This class constitutes a natural generalization of M-estimators of the scatter matrix and are defined as a solution to a penalized M-estimation cost function. Using the concept of geodesic convexity, the uniqueness of the regularized M-estimators of scatter and the uniqueness of the solution to the corresponding M-estimating equations are established. An iterative algorithm with proven convergence to the solution of the regularized M-estimating equation is also given. This research is joint with Esa Ollila, Aalto University, Finland and Lutz D mbgem, University of Bern, Switzerland.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/events/department-seminar-david-tyler-rutgers,36

1119,Quantum Computing: Transforming the Digital Age,Public lecture by Dr. Krysta Svore, Microsoft ResearchIn 1981, Richard Feynman proposed a device called a quantum computer to take advantage of the laws of quantum physics to achieve computational speed-ups over classical methods. Quantum computing promises to revolutionize how we compute. Over the course of three decades, quantum algorithms have been developed that offer fast solutions to problems in a variety of fields including number theory, optimization, chemistry, physics, and materials science. Quantum devices have also significantly advanced such that components of a scalable quantum computer have been demonstrated in a variety of quantum systems. In this talk, I will attempt to reveal some of the mysteries of this disruptive computational paradigm. I will showcase recent advances in quantum algorithms for real-world applications and in scalable, fault-tolerant devices.Registration is requiredBiographyDr. Krysta Svore is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, where she manages the Quantum Architectures and Computation group. Svore s research includes the development and implementation of quantum algorithms, including the design of a scalable, fault-tolerant software architecture for translating a high-level quantum program into a low-level, device-specific quantum implementation, and the study of quantum error correction codes and noise thresholds. She has also developed machine-learning methods for web applications, including ranking, classification, and summarization algorithms. Dr. Svore received an ACM Best of 2013 Notable Article award. In 2010, she was a member of the winning team of the Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science with highest distinction from Columbia University in 2006 and her B.A. from Princeton University in Mathematics and French in 2001. She is a Senior Member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), serves as a representative for the Academic Alliance of the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT), and is an active member of the American Physical Society (APS).ParkingVisitor parking is available in lot M for $6Ticket holders must be in their seats no later than 15 minutes prior to the start of the lecture.

1125,What&#039;s up with IF-AT? (CTE743),Location: EV1 241 Notes: Open to faculty (registration is required)IF-AT (Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique) cards are becoming a popular learning and assessment tool on campus. These cards permit multiple choice answers to be chosen by scratching the card surface (like a scratch and win card) so that students can attempt a question multiple times until they get the correct answer. They are used for individual or group learning and research suggests that being able to answer a question until the correct answer is determined can correct student thinking errors. When used in a group, the discussion around selecting the answers provides an opportunity for peer learning.We are bringing together a group of instructors who have used IF-AT cards in the last year to share how the cards were used in their classes, how the activities were graded and how the cards were effective for encouraging active learning. They ll also share any of their challenges with IF-AT activities. If you ve wondered if this strategy would be useful in your course, want to find out about the range of individual and group activities that the cards can be used for, or are just curious about the IF-AT technique please join us for this informal sharing session.Facilitator: Jane Holbrook, CTERegisterHelp with registration.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/events/whats-if-cte743,5

This presentation explores how we might design high impact learning experiences to foster iterative reflection for deep understanding and experiential thinking. The social construction of knowledge and understanding is a critically important consideration as we explore the power of learning communities and the choices students make when experiencing new and unfamiliar situations.This presentation builds on our Teaching and Learning Conference Theme, Making Teaching and Learning Visible, and continues our discussions related to High Impact Practices.There will be time for a question and answer period.

1074,GI Brown Bag Series: &quot;To Frag, to Explore, to Read: Text and Visual Realism in 1990s Videogames&quot;,The Games Institute (GI) presents the next session of a series of "Brown Bag Seminars" on May 28, 2015. Presenter: Michael HancockTopic: "To Frag, to Explore, to Read: Text and Visual Realism in 1990s Videogames"Abstract: At first glance, Myst and DOOM are very different games: one involves quiet contemplation of puzzles in a still world, and the other is frenetic shooting action in a demon-soaked dystopia. What they share is that they rose into prominence during a similar moment in videogame history, in which the advanced technology of the PC made (or at least seemed to make) 3D, realistic graphics for home gaming viable. The creators of both games capitalized on this notion, emphasizing on the graphics' ability to draw players into a fully realized videogame world. What tends to be minimized in this discussion is the role of text. In this presentation, I will explore how Myst and DOOM capitalize and perpetuate the narrative of graphical realism, while at the same time relying very heavily on text to ground their graphically immersive worlds.Date: May 28, 2015Time: 12 - 1:00pm*Where: GI (EC1)*Please note that food and drinks will not be provided; this event is for uWaterloo Faculty & Students ONLYAgenda:12:00 - 12:45pm Speaker's Presentation12:45pm - 1:00pm Questions and Discussion,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/games-institute/events/gi-brown-bag-series-frag-explore-read-text-and-visual,24

1053,PhD comprehensive exam | Alex Howse, Optimization Methods for Tensor Decompositions,MC 6496CandidateAlex Howse , Applied Mathematics, University of WaterlooTitleOptimization Methods for Tensor DecompositionsAbstractTensors, numerical multilinear arrays, are commonly used to organize and analyze data in applications throughout the sciences. Many of these applications make use of tensor decompositions, which express tensors as sums or products of several components, and can be used to obtain approximations in convenient formats. We consider the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), which expresses a tensor as the multilinear product of a tensor with typically smaller dimensions and a set of matrices with useful orthonormality properties. We present two optimization algorithms for computing HOSVD tensor approximations in a matrix manifold context: a nonlinearly preconditioned conjugate gradient (NPCG) iteration and a nonlinear GMRES iteration. In NPCG, a vector generated by a nonlinear preconditioner replaces the gradient in standard nonlinear conjugate gradient; and in nonlinear GMRES, a linear combination of past iterates and a tentative new iterate, generated by a nonlinear preconditioner, is minimized to produce an improved search direction. Numerical results show that these methods can significantly accelerate the standard iteration for computing HOSVD approximations.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/events/phd-comprehensive-exam-alex-howse-optimization-methods,7

951,Mediated Bodies: A Talk on New Books from English Faculty,The Department of English Language and Literature is pleased to invite you to Mediated Bodies, the first event in our Faculty Research Series. Come hear English authors Beth Coleman and Jay Dolmage speak about their recent books, and stay for discussion and refreshments.About our authors: Beth Coleman is the author of Hello Avatar: Rise of the Networked Generation (MIT Press). Hello Avatar examines a crucial aspect of our cultural shift from analog to digital: the continuum between online and off-, what she calls the x-reality that crosses between the virtual and the real. Coleman looks at the emergence of a world that is neither virtual nor real but encompasses a multiplicity of network combinations. And she argues that it is the role of the avatar to help us express our new agency--our new power to customize our networked life. By avatar, Coleman means not just the animated figures that populate our screens but the gestalt of images, text, and multimedia that make up our online identities--in virtual worlds like Second Life and in the form of email, video chat, and other digital artifacts. Exploring such network activities as embodiment, extreme (virtual) violence, and the work in virtual reality labs, and offering sidebar interviews with designers and practitioners, she argues that what is new is real-time collaboration and copresence, the way we make connections using networked media and the cultures we have created around this. The star of this drama of expanded horizons is the networked subject--all of us who represent aspects of ourselves and our work across the mediascape.Jay Dolmage is the author of Disability Rhetoric (Syracuse University Press), winner of a 2015 PROSE Award. Disability Rhetoric is the first book to view rhetorical theory and history through the lens of disability studies. Traditionally, the body has been seen as, at best, a rhetorical distraction; at worst, those whose bodies do not conform to a narrow range of norms are disqualified from speaking. Yet, Dolmage argues that communication has always been obsessed with the meaning of the body and that bodily difference is always highly rhetorical. Following from this rewriting of rhetorical history, he outlines the development of a new theory, affirming the ideas that all communication is embodied, that the body plays a central role in all expression, and that greater attention to a range of bodies is therefore essential to a better understanding of rhetorical histories, theories, and possibilities.Stay tuned for future events to follow in 2015-16!,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/english/events/mediated-bodies-talk-new-books-english-faculty,1

986,Thesis Defence: Morgan O’Reilly,Of the thesis entitled: Tempest Redux Abstract:I could write about what making a movie has to do with architecture, a question that has been posed to me countless times by family and friends who live happily outside of the architecture bubble. It s a question that I hate answering in a few cursory sentences in conversation. It s a question that s been explored scientifically and poetically by architects and filmmakers for nearly one hundred years. Filmmaker and theorist, Sergei Eisenstein revolutionized the relationship between architecture and film. In his essay Montage and Architecture he proclaimed architecture to be the ancestor of film and called the Acropolis of Athens the perfect example of one of the most ancient films. [ Sergei M. Eisenstein, Montage and Architecture. In Assemblage No. 10, 117 (1989)] The film plays as the human eye walks the orchestrated path through the spaces. I visited the Acropolis near the beginning of this endeavour. In the midst of an impulsive and financially ill-advised jaunt I found myself standing on the steps of the Propylaea very conscious of the composition in front of me; the first shot. While I cannot honestly call this trip a pilgrimage to worship at the shrine of the first film, reflecting upon my visit to the Acropolis, it provided the push that I needed to commit to this thesis. There it was in front of me, 2500 years old, the common ground. There s no need to get defensive when asked the seemingly ubiquitous question. This is where my thesis sits, not on the Acropolis, but in this mysterious territory excavated by Eisenstein and developed by Andrei Tarkovsky, Bernard Tschumi, Giuliana Bruno, to name a few who have been particularly influential in my case. It does not purport to expand on their brilliant work, to lay new ground. It is simply a film made by an architecture student because there is a place for that. The examining committee is as follows: Supervisor:Committee Members:Donald McKay, University of WaterlooRyszard Sliwka, University of Waterloo Dereck Revington, University of Waterloo External Reader:Dr. Val rie C. Kaelin, Ryerson University The committee has been approved as authorized by the Graduate Studies Committee.The Defence Examination will take place: Friday May 15, 201510:15AMArchitecture Room 1001 (Lawrence Cummings Lecture Theatre) A copy of the thesis is available for perusal in ARC 2106A.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/architecture/events/thesis-defence-morgan-oreilly,34

Traditionally, the body has been seen as, at best, a rhetorical distraction; at worst, those whose bodies do not conform to a narrow range of norms are disqualified from speaking. Yet, Dolmage argues that communication has always been obsessed with the meaning of the body and that bodily difference is always highly rhetorical. Following from this rewriting of rhetorical history, he outlines the development of a new theory, affirming the ideas that all communication is embodied, that the body plays a central role in all expression, and that greater attention to a range of bodies is therefore essential to a better understanding of rhetorical histories, theories, and possibilities.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/events/english-faculty-research-series-mediated-bodies,26

987,Department seminar by William Woodall, Virginia Tech,The Difficulty in Designing Process Monitoring Methods with Estimated In-Control ParametersThe performance of monitoring methods, such as the Shewhart control chart, with estimated in-control parameters has been widely discussed in the literature. Previous studies showed, for example, that at least 400/(n-1) Phase I samples, where n > 1 is the sample size, are required so that the - chart performs on average as if the in-control process parameter values were known. This recommendation was based on the in-control expected average run length (ARL) performance. The reliance on the expected ARL metric, however, neglects the practitioner-to-practitioner variability. This variability occurs due to the different historical data sets practitioners use, which results in varying parameter estimates, control limits, and in-control ARL values.In this presentation, it is shown that taking this additional type of variability into consideration leads to much larger Phase I samples, far beyond what many previous researchers have recommended, in order to have low levels of variation of in-control performance among practitioners. The standard deviation of the ARL (SDARL) metric is used to evaluate performance for various amounts of Phase I data. Surprisingly, we show that for a variety of methods no realistic Phase I sample size is sufficient to have confidence that the attained in-control performance is close to that desired. These results have significant implications on the relationship between process monitoring theory and practice. An alternative approach is presented for designing and evaluating process monitoring methods.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/events/department-seminar-william-woodall-virginia-tech,36

Come hear English authors Beth Coleman and Jay Dolmage speak about their recent books, and stay for discussion and refreshments.About our authors:Beth Coleman is the author of Hello Avatar: Rise of the Networked Generation (MIT Press). Hello Avatar examines a crucial aspect of our cultural shift from analog to digital: the continuum between online and off-, what she calls the x-reality that crosses between the virtual and the real. Coleman looks at the emergence of a world that is neither virtual nor real but encompasses a multiplicity of network combinations. And she argues that it is the role of the avatar to help us express our new agency--our new power to customize our networked life. By avatar, Coleman means not just the animated figures that populate our screens but the gestalt of images, text, and multimedia that make up our online identities--in virtual worlds like Second Life and in the form of email, video chat, and other digital artifacts.

971,Improving Written Feedback (CTE245),Location: EV1 241Description: It is well established that feedback plays a critical role in student learning. With the number of students attending University rising, the reliance on written feedback on student papers has drastically increased. However this rise has been met with dissatisfaction from both the students and the instructors, and often, their concerns are not aligned. As teaching assistants and instructors, how can we improve the effectiveness of our own written feedback to ensure that the time and effort we put into providing such feedback is most beneficial to foster student learning?In this workshop we identify reasons why written feedback can be ineffective, discuss potential strategies for improving its effectiveness and gain hands-on experience implementing these strategies into our own feedback practices.Notes:Participants will receive an attendance credit if they arrive on time and stay until the end of the event.Facilitator: Sara Scharoun, CTERegistration:RegisterHelp with registration,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/events/improving-written-feedback-cte245-1,5

972,Seminar - Dr. Amany El Gouharyl,SpeakerDr. Amany El GouharylTopicAn analysis of phase noise in transformer-based dual-tank oscillatorsAbstractNext generation wireless devices will be required to support a wide variety of commercial standards and operate over a wide range of frequency bands. Therefore, components that are capable of operating over ultra-wide frequency ranges are often required. One such major component in any communication system is oscillators. Furthermore, modern telecommunication standards require very low phase noise oscillators and, because of their outstanding noise performance, LC-oscillators, are a popular choice. Hence, a lot of effort has been invested in studying and improving the tuning range and the phase noise performance of LC oscillators. A popular architecture that is being utilized in the recent literature is the transformer-based (T-based) oscillator. T-based oscillators were introduced as a way of expanding the tuning range of LC-oscillators through dual-mode implementation. They have also been proposed for improving phase noise due to an enhanced quality factor. Yet, the phase noise analysis of T-based oscillators are generally lacking and equations that were derived for inductor-based (L-based) oscillators have been commonly adopted for T-based oscillators. The present analysis introduces a more accurate and complete phase noise analysis for T-based oscillators using the linear time variant model introduced by Hajimiri and Lee.Speaker's biographyAmany El Gouhary received both the B.S. and M.E. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City in 2006 and 2008. She received the B.S. degree in computer science from the American University in Cairo, Egypt. Amany received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA, in 2014. In 2010, She was awarded Texas Instruments scholarship. In 2011, Amany joined the op-amp team in Texas Instruments Inc., Tucson, AZ for four months in which she worked on improving the band-width and performance of a general purpose op-amp. Her research interests include analog/RF circuits for cognitive radio, with emphasis on LC-VCOs.Invited by Professor Slim Boumaiza,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/events/seminar-dr-amany-el-gouharyl,8

989,Thesis Defence: Joel Di Giacomo,Of the thesis entitled: Being: At The Threshold Abstract:What does it mean to have a transcendent experience, and what does architecture have to do with it? What is ineffable space?Philosphers such as Martin Heidegger and Gaston Bachelard would argue that a true, meaningful human existence can only be found at the threshold between the known, ordered, limited world, and the unknown, chaotic, unlimited world, where the two worlds are one, connected and indistinguishable.The question this thesis poses is what role architecture might play in activating this threshold, in engaging the unknown, in experiencing the sublime.It will investigate this by examining a series of sublime encounters and attempting to express them in architectural form. The examining committee is as follows: Supervisor:Committee Members:Rick Haldenby, University of WaterlooRyszard Sliwka, University of Waterloo Dereck Revington, University of Waterloo External Reader:Bojana Videkanic, University of Waterloo The committee has been approved as authorized by the Graduate Studies Committee.The Defence Examination will take place: Friday May 15, 20151:30PMArchitecture Room 2003 (Photo Studio) A copy of the thesis is available for perusal in ARC 2106A.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/architecture/events/thesis-defence-joel-di-giacomo,34

1091,CUT Research Projects Workshop (CTE146),Location: LIB 329Description: At this workshop you will learn what is required for the GS 902 research project component, as well as about research and referencing skills specific to higher education. This workshop is designed to be interactive and to start you on the process of narrowing your research question and identifying the 10 scholarly references needed for your project. You will be taught how to use various search strategies and research databases, and then you will use these strategies during the workshop to find possible resources for your own topic.To prepare for this workshop, you need to bring a proposed topic for your research project.

907,PhD comprehensive exam | Midhun Kathanaruparambil S., Stochastic simulation of reduced dimensional chemical master equation,MC 5417CandidateMidhun Kathanaruparambil S. , Applied Mathematics, University of WaterlooTitleStochastic simulation of reduced dimensional chemical master equationAbstractChemical master equation (CME) models of biochemical systems are typically of very high order. As the number of species, the molecular population of each species and the number of reaction channels increases, the order of the CME explodes. A complete statistical description of such a huge system is computationally expensive to attain. Moreover a biochemical system's inherent feature, multiple timescales, also makes the system more difficult to solve. By using timescale separation method and probability conservation on the reduced dimension, we can reduce the system to a significantly lower dimension. By this approach the biochemical system itself is reduced and the corresponding reduced chemical master equation's dynamics occur only on a slow timescale.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/events/phd-comprehensive-exam-midhun-kathanaruparambil-s-stochastic,7

908,Seminar - James Forbes,SpeakerDr. James Forbes, Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan, United StatesTopicEstimation and Control on the Special Orthogonal Group of Rigid-Body RotationsAbstractAutonomous ground, air, space, and marine vehicles are critically reliant on an accurate attitude estimate and a reliable control system for operation. For instance, in order to slew and point a science payload or antenna on-board a spacecraft, noisy sensor data must be fused together into an attitude estimate that is in turn used within an attitude control strategy. This talk will focus on recent developments in attitude estimation and control. First, deterministic SO(3)-based attitude estimation will be discussed. An estimator with a structure similar to Poisson s Equation and superior convergence properties compared to similar SO(3)-based estimators found in the literature will be presented. Estimating the rotation matrix (an element of SO(3)) directly is the motivation by the deficiencies of all attitude parametrizations (e.g., non-uniqueness and kinematic singularities). Second, SO(3)-based attitude control will be considered. Existing SO(3)-based controller have, effectively, a proportional-derivative (PD) structure; how to incorporate an angular velocity filter will be presented. This talk will close with a brief discussion of Prof. Forbes' other research interests, and future research.Speaker's biographyJames Richard Forbes grew up in Southern Ontario, Canada. James received his B.A.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (Honours, Co-op) from the University of Waterloo in 2006.

958,The Similarities between Maori and Chinese Cultures And Deeper meaning of Maori Tattoo &amp; Marae,A New Zealand Chinese writer is coming to talk about her first hand experience of learning about Maori culture.Guest LectureSong Lam QSM, Chinese New Zealand writerSong spent more than two years researching Maori legends, customs and history when she was studying at the University of Auckland with a major in Education and minor in Maori culture and history. She has had the privilege of meeting many Maori people and staying on different Marae (a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Polynesian societies) during her research. This has enriched her knowledge and understanding of Maori traditions, values and customs. Through her study, Song has found there are quite a number of similarities between Maori and Chinese cultures, such as languages, legends as well as customs. Song has been invited by different Universities and libraries in New Zealand and overseas to talk about these in a lot more detail. She will also introduce the deeper meaning of Maori Tattoo (Ta Moko) as well as the functions of Marae.Sponsored by Registration information:Call Damaris McKinley at 519-884-4400 ext.28645, or e-mail EAS@uwaterloo.caSpaces are limited.

975,Seminar - “How Living Cells Sense and Respond to their Mircoenvironment” by Mohammad R.K. Mofrad, Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley,ABSTRACT: It is now widely established that living cells sense mechanical signals and respond actively by changing their phenotype accordingly. This process, termed cellular mechanotransduction, is mediated by a combination of biochemical and biophysical mechanisms via conformational changes in the structure and function of specific molecules.These mechanosensing molecules can function to initiate key biological processes, e.g. formation of focal adhesions at the interface of cell s interaction with the extracellular microenvironment. Despite numerous studies in this field, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the adhesion of cells to their extracelluar matrix (ECM) remains remarkably incomplete. In this talk, I will present some of our recent efforts aimed at better understanding of the molecular players involved in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction at the cell-ECM interface and the mechanochemical pathways that extend the signals into the nucleus thereby eliciting a biological response from the cell by influencing changes in gene expression and protein synthesis.Bio-sketch: Mohammad R. K. Mofrad is professor of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering at the University of California Berkeley, where he is the director of Molecular Cell Biomechanics Laboratory (http://biomechanics.berkeley.edu) and also a faculty scientist with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Dr. Mofrad received his B.A.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, before moving to Canada where he received his M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Waterloo and University of Toronto, respectively. After post-doctoral work at MIT and Harvard Medical School, he joined the faculty at Berkeley in 2005. Recipient of the NSF CAREER award in 2010, Prof. Mofrad's research program encompasses the development of molecular and multiscale models of cell mechanobiology, with specific attention to the role of two integrated macromolecular systems, namely the nuclear pore complex and integrin-mediated focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are the immediate sites of cell's interaction with the extracellular microenvironment, and as such they play a key role in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction at the interface of the cell with the extracellular world. Nuclear pores exquisitely control the traffic in and out of the nucleus, thereby regulating the gene expression and protein synthesis. Dr. Mofrad has published in varied journals ranging from Biophysical Journal, Physical Review and PLoS to ACS Nano, Biomaterials, Journal of MEMS and Lab on Chip. He has co-edited three books, including "Cytoskeletal Mechanics: Models and Measurements in Cell Mechanics", "Cellular Mechanotransduction: Diverse Perspectives from Molecules to Tissue" published by Cambridge University Press. Dr. Mofrad currently serves on the editorial board of a few journals including ASME Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, Journal of Biomechanics, and PLoS One.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/events/seminar-how-living-cells-sense-and-respond-their,22

1013,MASc seminar - Pengyu Zhao,CandidatePengyu ZhaoTitleCollaborative Real-Time Interactive Billboard NetworksSupervisorPin-Han HoAbstractOnline advertising and marketing nowadays has become more and more popular, and there are increasing number of companies that comes into the battle of this market. As everyone can see, advertisement is dispensable part for almost every website. When we are browsing the websites, we have access to various advertisements. Some of them are even based on our activities in the browser so that the advertisements can be more relevant to us, and consequently increase the impressions and click on the advertisements. To make this kind of advertising more efficient and profitable not only benefits the advertiser, but also helps websites and advertising technology vendors to grow.There are many technology companies that provides the platform for websites and advertisers, where they websites can offer their advertisement spots and advertisers are able to pick their favorite places to render the advertisements. Since the process is very wide open on the Internet, it can involve huge amount of data which could be over million or even billion. Also most of advertising technology companies have real-time bidding system which really helps to activate the whole market and maximize the profit of advertisers, websites and themselves.However, as the online advertising roaring up, it seems the billboard market is left behind. Compared to websites advertisement spots, billboard is much more physical and harder to operate. billboard owners are using different players and CMS(content manage- ment systems) to operate their billboards. Those CMS may be costly, for which billboard owners may be not willing to replace their existing system with other new methods. So it will be difficult and complicated to integrate different individual billboard operating networks together. But good news is people are choosing digital LED billboard over other kinds of billboards because it is easier to control and can provide more options to advertis- ers in terms of the type of advertisements. Therefore, i may be a good time to incorporate a system that helps to involve all the digital billboards under the hood and make outdoor billboard advertising as efficient as online advertising.Firstly, in order to contain billboards as many as possible, we need one single place for billboard owners to show and describe their billboards, and meanwhile advertisers can are able to see those information and make their decisions based on the locations and the prices. Secondly, to be able to distribute the advertisement contents to the billboards, a hardware is required to install in the billboard so that it can communicate with the server and grab the content and the schedule. Thirdly, to increase the compatibility between different existing billboard management systems that billboard owners are using themselves, the hardware has to be an add-on device which does not interfere the original work flows. Finally, the system should allow convenient interaction between advertisements and consumers so that the consumers can access the resources of the products or services which are being advertised, just like an end user clicking an advertisement on the Internet. Based on these four perspectives, a collaborative real-time interactive system for billboards is introduced and discussed.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/events/masc-seminar-pengyu-zhao,8

927,MASc seminar - Mohammadreza Memarian,CandidateMohammadreza MemarianTitleNovel Finger-like Soft Pneumatic Actuators for Affective MovementSupervisorsDana Kulic and Robert Gorbet (Knowledge Integration)AbstractThe ability to communicate emotion through movement is an important element to enable engaging social human-robot interaction. It has been shown that humans are capable of conveying emotion through hand and arm movements alone. Thus, simple robotics structures might be capable of emotion conveyance. In this thesis, the design and implementation of a finger-like robotic structure capable of performing movements that convey emotion is investigated. First, the requirements for such a mechanism are derived directly from human affective movement dynamics, coupled with application- specific constraints. Comparative analysis is performed on various actuation options based on these requirements. Studies suggest that fast dynamic motion is required for the conveyance of many emotions. Therefore, the analysis focused on determining actuation options that can produce controllable finger-like motion with fast dynamics. A class of pneumatic actuators called soft pneumatic artificial muscles (SPAMs) were determined to fit the requirements for finger-like affective motion better than the other available actuator options.SPAMs are a type of pneumatic actuator that provides customizable motion trajectories in three dimensional space without the need for rigid links or a transmission mechanism. The motion of these actuators can be designed to be similar to the motion of the human finger. Their motion also achieves high velocities and accelerations. In addition, SPAMs provide high power to weight ratios and are compliant, making them suitable for interaction with human users.In this thesis, a novel design for producing SPAMs, named wrapped SPAMs (WSPAMs) is introduced. Unlike previous SPAM designs, the production process of WSPAM is highly repeatable, while the motion trajectory can be easily tailored at the design stage. A model is presented for predicting the steady state angular displacement of the WSPAM actuator based on its geometrical parameters and the elasticity of the materials used in its production. The model is validated by experimental analysis. Two sets of experiments are designed and presented. The first set enables the estimation of the model parameters. In the second set of experiments, the estimated parameters are used to model WSPAMs through the possible range of design parameters. Six WSPAMs with design parameters within the physical limitations are constructed. Comparison of their performance against the modeled results is presented, and shows that the model is capable of estimating the performance of WSPAM within the physical limitations of its design.Finally, a pneumatic circuit and a closed-loop controller for the finger-like movement of these soft pneumatic actuators is developed. An innovative approach, which uses a gyroscopic sensor, is used to add feedback on the position of these actuators and make closed-loop control possible. Additionally, a simple and low-cost solution is designed to significantly improve the noisy behavior of the existing pneumatic driving mechanisms. The proposed controller design is validated on physical SPAM prototypes. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the pneumatic and control system for the actuator, and its ability to track human movement trajectories with affective content.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/events/masc-seminar-mohammadreza-memarian,8
944,Japanese Fish Scooping Game,Are you ready to accept the challenge of Goldfish Scooping and maybe take home a new friend?Goldfish scooping is coming to the University of Waterloo.Goldfish scooping ( , Kingyo-sukui) is atraditional Japanese game in which a player scoops goldfish with a special scooper. It is also called, "Scooping Goldfish", "Dipping for Goldfish" or "Snatching Goldfish". "Kingyo" means goldfish in Japanese and "sukui" means scooping.The rules:Each person plays individually. The basic rule of the game is that the player must use a paper scooper called a "poi" to scoop goldfish out of a pool and into a bowl. The poi can tear easily and therefore players must play with care and speed. A player can continue the playing the game with a torn poi but when the poi is completely broken or incapable of scooping properly, the game is over.The Federation of Students is hosting Goldfish Scooping on May 13, 2015 for Waterloo students who are up to the challenge - some lucky winners may go home with a goldfish!,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/english-language-institute/events/japanese-fish-scooping-game,3

911,CUT Teaching Dossiers (CTE113),Location: EV1-241Description: At this workshop, you will learn what a teaching dossier is and how you can use one. We will analyze two sample dossiers - an activity which you will begin before the workshop - to discover what constitutes an effective dossier. From there, we will turn to the teaching philosophy statement, which is a critical component of the dossier but is also the most difficult to articulate. We will engage in an interactive metaphor exercise to demonstrate one tool that you can use to help create your own philosophy statement. You will receive additional resources at the workshop.To prepare for this workshop, you need to do two tasks:Read the two sample dossiers (found in GS902 course in Waterloo LEARN) so that you can complete the worksheet (also in Waterloo LEARN). Bring your responses and the dossiers to the workshop for a group discussion.Choose a metaphor that describes you as a teacher (for example, gardener, architect, travel guide). Bring this with you to use in a small group exercise.Facilitator: Kristin Brown, CTENotes:Open to CUT participants registered in GS902 onlyRegistration requiredRegisterHelp with registration,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/events/cut-teaching-dossiers-cte113-0,5

929,Ecohydrology Seminar Series: Dr. Elodie Passeport,Fate of Organic Contaminants in Aquatic Environments: Contribution from Radio and Stable Isotope ChemistryPresented by Dr. Elodie Passeport, Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto, cross appointed in Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry.Abstract:Many synthetic organic chemicals we use everyday contaminate our aquatic resources, and threaten the health of humans and ecosystems. Their adverse effects can be partially limited via the natural or artificially enhanced treatment capabilities of the environment.In this seminar, I will discuss the ability of a constructed wetland and a forest buffer to remove pesticides in an agricultural catchment. I will present the results from a three-year long field study which demonstrated that both systems improved water quality. Such field-scale data do not allow understanding the dominant processes that account for the observed percent reductions . As a result, complementary laboratory experiments were conducted using wetland sediments, wetland plants, forest soil, and forest litter sampled on-site. On these substrates, 14C radio-labeled pesticides were used to study epoxiconazole (fungicide) degradation under flooded conditions as well as adsorption and desorption of isoproturon, metazachlor (herbicides) and epoxiconazole. The adsorption and desorption potential varied among the molecules and substrates, and epoxiconazole showed slow but possible degradation under anoxic conditions.While effective, molecules labeled with radio-isotopes can only be used under highly controlled lab conditions. Stable isotopes are gaining popularity for investigating in situthe occurrence of natural degradation of molecules. I will illustrate this feature through two examples investigating the fate of chlorinated benzenes in a contaminated aquifer and in the sediment layer of a contaminated groundwater surface water interface.Short Biography:Professor Elodie Passeport is cross-appointed in the departments of Civil Engineering, and Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry. She did her PhD at AgroParisTech and Irstea in France, and then moved to UC-Berkeley for a first Post Doctoral position in Professor Terry s lab, and then to the University of Toronto in the Earth Sciences department for a second Post Doctoral position with Professor Sherwood Lollar. Her research group studies the fate and removal of contaminants from water, in natural and engineered environments. Her research is experimental and involves lab and field studies, and the development of analytical methods to determine concentrations and stable isotope signatures of organic contaminants.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/ecohydrology/events/ecohydrology-seminar-series-dr-elodie-passeport,17

947,Geometry Working Seminar,Raymond Cheng, Pure Math Department, University of Waterloo Bundles over Complex Tori I shall begin our bundle of fun this semester by discussing holomorphic vector bundles over complex tori. After boring the audience with familiar generalities about vector bundles, I will delve into concrete matters and discuss the problem of classifying holomorphic vector bundles over complex tori. This problem was solved long ago by Atiyah for elliptic curves, elliptic curves being the common alias for complex tori of dimension 1. In higher dimensions, Matsushima and Morimoto have obtained a partial classification for bundles admitting a holo- morphic connection. In presenting these results, I will primarily sketch useful techniques for working with bundles and will hopefully provide some techniques that you can try at home.M3 2134,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/events/geometry-working-seminar-2,16
963,The Similarities between Maori and Chinese Cultures And Deeper meaning of Maori Tattoo &amp; Marae,A New Zealand Chinese writer is coming to talk about her first hand experience of learning about Maori culture.Guest LectureSong Lam QSM, Chinese New Zealand writerSong spent more than two years researching Maori legends, customs and history when she was studying at the University of Auckland with a major in Education and minor in Maori culture and history. She has had the privilege of meeting many Maori people and staying on different Marae (a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Polynesian societies) during her research. This has enriched her knowledge and understanding of Maori traditions, values and customs. Through her study, Song has found there are quite a number of similarities between Maori and Chinese cultures, such as languages, legends as well as customs. Song has been invited by different Universities and libraries in New Zealand and overseas to talk about these in a lot more detail. She will also introduce the deeper meaning of Maori Tattoo (Ta Moko) as well as the functions of Marae.Registration information:,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/renison/events/similarities-between-maori-and-chinese-cultures-and-deeper,30

997,PhD comprehensive exam | Mikhail Panine, Infinitesimal and Finite Methods in Inverse Spectral Geometry,MC 6496CandidateMikhail Panine. , Applied Mathematics, University of WaterlooTitleInfinitesimal and Finite Methods in Inverse Spectral GeometryAbstract Spectral geometry is the study of the relationship between the shape of a compact Riemannian manifold and the spectra of differential operators, typically Laplacians, defined on it. Of particular interest is the attempt to recover the manifold from knowledge of the spectrum alone. This is known as inverse spectral geometry. It is well known that the program of inverse spectral geometry taken in its most general form is not possible due to the existence of counterexamples: manifolds with different shape but the same spectrum. Still, a working theory of inverse spectral geometry would have applications in various areas such as shape recognition, computer graphics and quantum gravity. It is thus of interest to circumvent those obstacles by restricting the scope of inverse spectral geometry. This can be done by reducing the studied class of shapes or by adding additional information to the spectrum. Alternatively, it is of interest to quantify the prevalence of counterexamples. In particular, it would be useful to show that they are negligible in some satisfactory sense.Concretely, I study a linearized version of the inverse spectral problem by both numeric and analytic methods, I attempt to augment the information contained in the spectrum of the Laplacian by giving it a meaningful ordering, I try distinguishing pairs of isospectral non-isometric manifolds by the spectra of their neighboring shapes and, finally, I propose a method that could restrict or perhaps even rule out the existence of certain continuous families of isospectral non-isometric manifolds. I also discuss some tangentially related research projects pertaining to alternative expressions of integrals such as Fourier and Laplace transforms and ultraviolet cutoffs of quantum fields over generic space-times.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/events/phd-comprehensive-exam-mikhail-panine-infinitesimal-and,7

915,MASc seminar - Rajan Joshua Gill,CandidateRajan Joshua GillTitleRobust Spline Path Following for Redundant Mechanical SystemsSupervisorsDana Kulic and Christopher NielsenAbstractSpline Path Following for Redundant Mechanical Systems Path following controllers make the output of a control system approach and traverse a pre-specified path with no a priori time-parametrization. The first part of the thesis implements a path following controller for a simple class of paths, based on transverse feedback linearization (TFL), which guarantees invariance of the path to be followed. The coordinate and feedback transformation employed allows one to easily design control laws to generate arbitrary desired motions on the path for the closed-loop system. The approach is applied to an uncertain and simplified model of a fully actuated robot manipulator for which none of the dynamic parameters are measured. The controller is made robust to modelling uncertainties using Lyapunov redesign. The experimental results show a substantial improvement when using the robust controller for path following versus standard state feedback.In this next part of the thesis, the class of paths and systems considered are extended. We present a method for path following control design applicable to framed curves generated by spline interpolating waypoints in the workspace of kinematically redundant mechanical systems. The class of admissible paths include self-intersecting curves. The class of redundant systems include mobile manipulators with a large class of wheeled ground vehicles. Kinematic redundancies are resolved by designing controllers that solve a suitably defined constrained quadratic optimization problem. The approach is experimentally verified on a 4-degree-of-freedom (4DOF) redundant manipulator and a mobile manipulator system with a differential drive base.,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,2015-05-12 03:35:10.433767,https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/events/masc-seminar-rajan-joshua-gill,8

Persuasive Health Technology emphasizes the design of empathic health technologies, adaptive to personalities and tailored to individual needs and skills, through mobile devices and ambient technologies, invisible and embedded in the environment that surrounds people. Persuasive technology provides methods and strategies to create trust, user-engagement and adherence via empathic and person-adaptive designs. It provides means for reinventing healthcare via co-creation with the end-users (caregivers, caretakers, family carers) and involvement of stakeholders (decision makers, policy makers and industrial organization). The ambition of Persuasive Health Technology research and education is to develop, implement and evaluate health technology that is feasible, trustworthy and user-friendly. The aim is to:Improve healthcare by increasing patient safety and reducing health risks via smart, tailored and personalized decision support systems.Improve readiness for independent aging and living. The aim is to contribute to a participative society by innovative and user-friendly technologies that are implementable in society. Patients and citizens can use care and assistance that is accessible, affordable and usable.Decrease the load on intramural care by supporting self-management, to extend current care with innovative concepts for healthy living.Contribute to quality of care through the use of digital information and communication technologies in primary and secondary processes.Contribute to protection and improvement of public health through the use of digital information and communication technologies.Establish an infrastructure via innovative Life Long Learning systems for implementation of eLearning-concepts in HealthCare (blended eLearning) and in Education (Massive Open Online Course, online Instructional technology). At the moment, such an approach is needed to improve knowledge dissemination and to realize readiness for Healthy living in practice.Strengthen the profile of Psychology, Health and Technology in tuition according to TOM, the new educational model of the University of Twente. In particular, to improve the skills and competencies in designing and evaluation of eHealth interventions. The potential of educational technologies such as eLearning, distant learning and blended learning will be explored to improve the efficiency and to widen the scope (UMCG, medical students; healthcare professionals).These aims converge with the European ICT for Health programs (Horizon 2020; EU Policy for eHealth), the ambitions to bridge University of Waterloo with the University of Twente in the creation of a smart Health Network and with the visions of University of Twente and the faculty of Behavioural, Management & Social Sciences (Technology4People). To achieve these ambitions, in the upcoming years cooperation with health informatics and medical disciplines is indispensable. Position of Prof Dr. Lisette van Gemert-Pijnen at UMCG and Waterloo can be a driver for realizing these aims.International Funding is important to facilitate the research and education ambitions. The ambition is to acquire funding from national, and international Grants (e.g., INTERREG; Horizon 2020 projects). In particular, the focus is on 3 research topics: User and Usage centered development methods; Persuasive designs for affection and adherence; and the Implementation strategies for adoption and integration in practice.Their talk will focus on smart monitoring and coaching to prevent complications and to promote independent living and mobility (citizen centered safe and self-care). In particular, Dr. Olga Kulyk will talk about persuasive design for peripheral visualizations, awareness applications, affective feedback and evaluation methods for measuring situational awareness, group dynamics and persuasiveness. They will demonstrate their holistic iterative approach on the recent project examples, hoping to trigger fruitful discussion.Biosketch:Lisette van Gemert-Pijnen:Dr. van Gemert-Pijnen studied psycho-linguistics (development of a language therapy for patients with mental disturbances, aphasia) and obtained her PhD in improving compliance with safe care protocols in Healthcare (e.g. MRSA, Hep.
